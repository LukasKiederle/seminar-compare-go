# seminar-compare-go
## Setup:
- clone repo
- Install Jetbrains PyCharm Ide. This automatically installs python 3.6.
- If not, install it in the setting -> project interpreter settings.
- open project
- Open the [testmain.py](https://github.com/LukasKiederle/seminar-compare-go/blob/master/test/testmain.py) file
- call the test functions and take a look at the console output
- Running this program just from cli is a little bit harder to achieve. If it is your desired way
you need to export all used imported files in the testmain.py file to the PATH variable (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38276027/import-statement-is-not-working-when-running-python-script-from-the-command-line). I dind't
do this. It takes much more time than just using the smart jetbrains ide.
